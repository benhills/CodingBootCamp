    "1) Use `np.load()` to load the data file at ./data/data.npy. You might need to query the function with the `?` to learn how it works. Inspect the shape of the array you loaded. Try pulling out a pair of points at a certain index and saving them as a tuple. We will use this dataset throughout the remainder of the intermediate notebooks, so start saving your work on it in the empty notebook at ./DatasetAnswers.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Find a new Python module on the internet. Find one relevant to your research if you can! or a random one is fine if you can't find anything useful quickly. Import it here with `!pip install [your_module]`, then try exploring it and using it if it is simple enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) *Challenge*: Try writing your own module in an external .py file. (*Hint*: the file must begin with '#!/usr/bin/env python3'). Write a function inside that file and call it from this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) *Challenge*: Bring your sorting algorithm into this notebook and time how long it takes to sort a random list. Compare this sorting time to that of `np.sort()`. (*Hint*: Use the `time` module to start/stop a clock for the sorting algorithm)."
