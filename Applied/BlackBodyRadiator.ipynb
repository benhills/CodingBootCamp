    "\n",
    "1) Write the above equation as a function. You will need to look up the relevant constants. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Plot the result from your function for a single temperature but over a range of frequencies.\n",

    "3) Plot the result from your function for a single frequency but over a range of temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Combine (2) and (3) for a plot with two independent variables (frequency and temperature). Some creativity is required here. *Hint: color is commonly used for the third variable*\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Add bounds for ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands to your plot. You can look up the relevant frequencies from any standard electromagnetic spectrum online. "
